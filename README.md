# 1. Learn Basics Concept of Python

## What is Python?
* Created in 1991 by Guido Van Rossum
* Named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus
* Is an interpreted, Object-Oriented, High Level Programming Language with dynamic semantics.
* Gained popularity because of its clear syntax and readability

## Why Learn Python?
Python’s syntax is very easy to understand. The lines of code required for a task is less compared to other languages. Let me give you an example – If I have to print “Welcome To Edureka!”  all I have to type:

print (“Welcome To Edureka!”)

Let’s see, What experts have to say about Python:

* Simple and Easy to learn
* Free and open source
* High Level Language
* Support different programming paradigm
    - Object Oriented
    - Procedure Oriented
    - Functional Oriented
    - Imperative Oriented
* Portable

# 2. Downloading & Installation
I will be installing Python in Windows 10 OS. You can try installing Python in Linux, Mac etc. If you face any issue mention it in the comments section.

### Following are the steps to install Python
* Step1: 1. Go to www.python.org/downloads/
* Step2: Select the Operating System and also the version of Python. I am downloading 3.6.0 in my windows machine.  Open the installer and click on “Run”.
* Step3: Click on “Install Now” and check on “Add Python 3.6 to PATH”.
* Step4: Start IDLE which is a Python GUI and start scripting.


### Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
IDE typically provides code editor, compiler/ interpreter and debugger in one GUI (Graphical User Interface). It encapsulates the entire process of code creation, compilation and testing which increases the productivity of developers.

A developer working with an IDE starts with a model, which the IDE translates into suitable code. The IDE then debugs and tests the model-driven code, with a high level of automation. Once the build is successful and properly tested, it can be deployed for further testing through the IDE or other tools outside of the IDE.

# 3. Python Applications:
* Artificial Intelligence
* Data Science
* Desktop Application
* Automation
* Web Development
* Data Wrangling, Exploration And Visualization


# 4. Python Variables
* A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. 
* Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

### Python Variable Name Rules
* Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)
* Other characters can be letters, numbers or _
* Case Sensitive.
* Can be any (reasonable) length.
* There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.

## Python Tokens
* Keyword
    - Python keywords are special reserve keywords
* Identifiers
    - Names that the programmer defines
* Literals
    - Values classified by types: e.g., numbers, truth values, text
* Operators
    - Symbols that operate on data and produce results
    
# 5. Python Tokens: Keywords
* Python keywords are special reserve keywords
* Convey a special meaning to the compiler/interpreter
* Each keywords have a special meaning and a specific operation
* Keywords CANNOT be used as variable

# 6. Python Tokens: Identifiers
* Identifiers are the name to identify a variable, function, class or an object
* RULES defined for naming an identifiers:
    - No special character except underscore (_) can be used as an identifier
    - Keywords should not be used as an identifiers
    - Python is case sensitive, i.e. Var and var are two different identifier
    - First character of an identifier can be character, underscore(_) but not digit.
    
# 7. Python Tokens: Literals
Literals are data given in a variable or constant
* String Literals
    - Formed by enclosing a text in the quotes
    - Both single and double quotes can be used
* Numeric Literals
    - Int   |   long    |   Float   |   Complex
* Boolean Literals
    - Can have only two values: 	True    |   False
* Special Literals
    - Python has one special literal: None
    - Used to specify to the field that is not created

# 8. Python Tokens: Operators
* Arithmetic Operator
* Assignment Operator
* Comparison Operator
* Logical Operator
* Bitwise Operator
* Identity Operator
* Membership Operator
